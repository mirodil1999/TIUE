							Dear educators, students and Families
							<br>
							<br>
							With a great enthusiasm I am proud to welcome you to one of the most inspirational placesnot only
							of learning, but also discovering, exploring, and in collaboration with highly qualified educators
							transforming the world- Tashkent International University of Education (TIUE).
							<br>
							<br>
							Our University has been the eighth university that takes place in the higher education life of
							Uzbekistan and was established in accordance with the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of the
							Republic of Uzbekistan "On the establishment of the international University "Tashkent
							International University of Education" No. 404 dated June 23, 2020.
							<br>
							<br>
							The whole world has long recognized the enormous contribution of great Central Asian philosophers
							to the development of world science and culture, such as Muhamad Musa al-Khwarizmi, Ahmad
							al-Ferghani, Abunasra al-Farabi , Abu Ali Ibn Sina , Abu RayhanBeruni. To this day, the main idea
							of Eastern thinkers lies at the heart of the educational process of modern Uzbekistan, which is
							that scientific knowledge and work contribute to the development of the best moral qualities that
							lead to spiritual development, improvement of the mind, consciousness, intelligence, and critical
							thinking.
							<br>
							<br>
							Our primary purpose is creating an innovative ecosystem in the country by facilitating of
							cultivation of modern leaders in Education, Science, Government and Public services. Our mission is
							to provide an applied learning environment that allows all participants to discover, examine
							critically, preserve and transmit the knowledge, wisdom and values that will help to promote
							innovation, creativity, research and entrepreneurship.
							<br>
							<br>
							TIUE was created to solve significant tasks for the present and future generations and, vertically
							integrating, in 2020-2023, the University will work hard in the following areas:
							<br>
							<br>
							Higher education- Bachelor's degree in three programs- pedagogical subjects, including the STEAM
							education, in information and communication subjects and in business management.
							We provide our students full-time, part-time, evening, special correspondence and distance learning
							in Uzbek, English and other languages.
							<br>
							<br>
							The amount of knowledge that our youth received during school does not meet the requirements of
							universities. We want to raise their educational level and further enroll not only in our
							University, but also in the universities of our Uzbekistan, where there are about 15 different
							branches of foreign universities, as well as 8 private universities.
							<br>
							<br>
							We decided to prepare our young people for admission to Universities and created The Transformation
							hub for developing the mind-set and fundamental concepts underlying the four core competencies:
							critical thinking, creative thinking, effective communication, effective interaction.The
							Transformation hub provide successful admission of applicants To higher education institutions of
							Uzbekistan, international Universities of Near and Far Abroad, using educational programs in
							cooperation with established international schools and guaranteed admission of students to
							undergraduate programs from the 2nd year in foreign Universities of the Near and Far Abroad.
							<br>
							<br>
							Management training-Leadership Academy is the actual solution for improving the quality of
							theoretical and practical knowledge and skills of administrative staff in the field of management.
							<br>
							<br>
							Today, most of the teachers working in the secondary education system have low qualifications.
							During last year's certification for 2019, which was attended by almost 57 thousand teachers and
							mentors, 43% of those certified received low grades, and the average for the Republic was 64 points
							on the 100-point system. This is a clear sign of an imperfect system of professional development of
							teachers, which requires updating the methodological support.
							<br>
							<br>
							Our university offers program on Professional development of teachers of secondary schools to
							improve the professional skills of teachers and the quality of their teaching in secondary schools.
							<br>
							<br>
							A fresh start is always the harbinger of novelty for the institutions as well as it is for the life
							of people. The fast-paced and changing business world and social needs have made it necessary for
							our students to develop themselves individually apart from their learning areas. In this respect,
							it is our primary goal to build education and training programs that will enable our students in
							all programs to gain the competencies described as the necessities of 21st century, to make it
							possible for them to grow up as democratic, free-thinking, broad-minded individuals, and to create
							a campus environment for this purpose.
							<br>
							<br>
							As TIUE Chancellor, I view myself as a servant leader. That is, I believe my job is to work on
							behalf of the entire TIUE community.
							<br>
							<br>
							Hereby, TIUE invites students, academics and educators who believe that they can transform and
							bring a new breath to the development of the educational environment, learn more about our
							University and join our creative community.
							<br>
							<br>
							I consider it is a great honor to serve this new, but with far-reaching goalsinstitution and its
							community as TIUE’s first chancellor!
							<br>
							<br>
							With best wishes,
							UlugbekKasimkhadjayev
							TIUE Chancellor
